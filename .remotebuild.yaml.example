# Example configuration file for remotebuild
# Copy this file to .remotebuild.yaml and customize for your project

# SSH host to connect to
# Can be user@hostname or just hostname if using SSH config
host: user@hostname

# Full path on remote server where project will be synced
# Will be created if it doesn't exist
remote_path: ~/remotebuild-cache/myproject

# Build command to run on remote server
# This can be any command that works on the remote server
# Examples:
#   - "make"
#   - "cargo build --release"
#   - "./build.sh"
#   - "cmake --build build"
build_command: make

# Artifacts to copy back from remote to local
# Paths are relative to the remote_path directory
artifacts:
  - "build/output.bin"
  - "build/output.elf"

# Optional: Additional patterns to exclude from sync
# These are added to the default exclusions (.git, .gitignore, build/, etc.)
exclude_patterns:
  - "*.log"
  - "temp/"
  - "*.tmp"

# Optional: Enable git-aware file syncing (default: true)
# When true, only syncs files tracked by git plus untracked files not in .gitignore
# This makes incremental builds much faster
git_aware: true

# Optional: Output level (default: minimal)
# - minimal: Single-line status with spinner (cleanest for automation)
# - normal: Multi-line status with completion messages
# - verbose: Shows detailed file transfer and build logs
output: minimal
